  <p>Morris had been standing in line for four hours, he never would&rsquo;ve guessed getting a human sacrifice was such a hassle.</p>
<p>The Bureau for Religious Sacrifice was known for being the slowest in the whole Department. This was mostly due to the habit of sacrificing their best workers to a variety of gods in the hope of acquiring their favour so they would bless them by speeding up the process. This had proven to be counterproductive.</p>

<p>Chains clattered as they were dragged across the ground by the ghostly and ghastly creature. The gates of hell gave a rusty sigh as they slammed close again.</p>
<p>The girl froze in place. The sight of the ungodly creatures burned its way through her eyes. Unable to process what was happening her brain literally melted. The creature&rsquo;s dark tongue eagerly lapped it up as it came oozing out of her eye sockets.</p>

  <p>It had been The Kid’s dream ever since he started boxing, his therapist had suggested it as a way to work out his anger, his anger about himself, his situation and the world, it was just supposed to be an outlet, but as soon as he picked up those gloves he had dreamed of a shot at the title.</p>
<p>He never made it far enough to have a chance for that dream to come through. He could blame everyone and everything. He didn’t have the time to train properly, he didn’t have the means, no coach ever took him seriously. Maybe he was right, but deep down he always feared the real reason was himself. He didn’t think he was good enough, or if he was good enough he didn’t think he had the drive, even if he had the drive he feared he would never be able to focus his drive and his strength.</p>

  <p>The sister removed her hands from her brother&rsquo;s eyes revealing the old abandoned hospital making him totally freak out in excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to be kidding? There&rsquo;s no way you got a table at <em>Leben</em>? There&mdash; there&rsquo;s a waiting list of several months. How did you do it?&rdquo; He asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got us on the waiting list. There&rsquo;s not much to it really, you just have to wait a bit,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

  <p>Dorian Bae was the man Sabrina had dreamed of her whole life. No, that&rsquo;s not true. He was more than she had ever dreamed of. He was more handsome. He was kinder.</p>
<p>He was, as her friend had put it, a hunk beyond dreams.</p>
<p>He had a chiseled and strong yet playful face with a smirk that could have saved the titanic, because it would melt anyone and anything.</p>
<p>His body was muscular and defined, but at the same time warm and inviting, with big arms that could wrap around you so tightly you would forget the whole world.</p>
