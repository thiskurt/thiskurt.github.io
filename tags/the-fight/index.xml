      <description>It had been The Kidâ€™s dream ever since he started boxing, his therapist had suggested it as a way to work out his anger, his anger about himself, his situation and the world, it was just supposed to be an outlet, but as soon as he picked up those gloves he had dreamed of a shot at the title.
He never made it far enough to have a chance for that dream to come through.</description>
