      <description>What she was afraid of turned out to be true. Some band of idiots was waking up the whole village. That was the biggest flaw in her plan, anyone could walk into town and start waking them up.
If only the fairies had kept the antidote to the sleeping trick to themselves, but that was the trouble with fairies, they were always telling their tales.
She had to stop them, she would just put them under a sleeping spell too and keep the plan going.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;A whole town of sleeping beauties. Well,&amp;rdquo; Jerre eyed a woman sleeping on a pile of dirty linen, &amp;ldquo;in a manner of speaking. We&amp;rsquo;ve got quite the job ahead of us.&amp;rdquo;
He eyed the woman again and turned towards Aldric and Milena, &amp;ldquo;I think the Commander intended for me to have more of a supervising position in this task, I am a senior Guard after all. Why don&amp;rsquo;t you start, Aldric?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;You just interrupted a lovely Hex-Mex lunch, I hope it&amp;rsquo;s worth it,&amp;rdquo; the Head Godmother said.
&amp;ldquo;I think someone is breaking the sleeping spell.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I knew she shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have used the sleeping trick again, it&amp;rsquo;s outdated. She&amp;rsquo;s always resorting to the same tricks,&amp;rdquo; the Head Godmother&amp;rsquo;s assistant, who had always hated the Fairy, said.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not the same trick, it&amp;rsquo;s an entirely different scheme, just because the magic&amp;rsquo;s the same&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Bob and Laura, you cover the part of town past the bakery,&amp;rdquo; the Commander said, &amp;ldquo;Jerre, you and I&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Ahem,&amp;rdquo; Reinhilde, the burly, imposing guard who&amp;rsquo;d been standing next to the Commander ahemed. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re at it again,&amp;rdquo; she pointed towards the Dreamy Archer and the Beautiful Magic Wielder who were making out under a tree.
&amp;ldquo;Unbelievable. And they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be the Guards that are actually capable,&amp;rdquo; the Commander said ignoring the looks the other guards gave him, &amp;ldquo;Reinhilde, can you do something about this?</description>

      <description>The Fairy sensed her magic spell being broken. Someone in the village had already woken up. The duke couldn&amp;rsquo;t have arrived yet; someone else must have discovered the place. Whoever these fools were they were ruining everything, ruining her only chance to make it into the Fairy Godmothers.
The Fairy Godmothers where neither fairies nor godmothers, they were simply short, stout witches&amp;mdash;all of them; no one dared question their hiring practices&amp;mdash;with a knack for cons wrapped in fairy tale lore.</description>

      <description>“We better start kissing,” the Commander said.
This was not the kind of order you’d expect from a man like Commander Godfried, broad and serious looking with big bushy mutton chops that met up with an equally bushy moustache. He had the big frame and muscles of a knight and the gently expanding belly of a recent retiree.
“What!?” One of the guards, an old friend of the Commander, replied.</description>
