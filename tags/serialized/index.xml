      <description>&amp;ldquo;Bob and Laura, you cover the part of town past the bakery,&amp;rdquo; the Commander said, &amp;ldquo;Jerre, you and I&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Ahem,&amp;rdquo; Reinhilde, the burly, imposing guard who�d been standing next to the Commander ahemed. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re at it again,&amp;rdquo; she pointed towards the Dreamy Archer and the Beautiful Magic Wielder who were making out under a tree.
&amp;ldquo;Unbelievable. And they�re supposed to be the Guards that are actually capable,&amp;rdquo; the Commander said ignoring the looks the other guards gave him, &amp;ldquo;Reinhilde, can you do something about this?</description>

      <description>The Fairy sensed her magic spell being broken. Someone in the village had already woken up. The duke couldn&amp;rsquo;t have arrived yet; someone else must have discovered the place. Whoever these fools were they were ruining everything, ruining her only chance to make it into the Fairy Godmothers.
The Fairy Godmothers where neither fairies nor godmothers, they were simply short, stout witches&amp;mdash;all of them; no one dared question their hiring practices&amp;mdash;with a knack for cons wrapped in fairy tale lore.</description>

      <description>“We better start kissing,” the Commander said.
This was not the kind of order you’d expect from a man like Commander Godfried, broad and serious looking with big bushy mutton chops that met up with an equally bushy moustache. He had the big frame and muscles of a knight and the gently expanding belly of a recent retiree.
“What!?” One of the guards, an old friend of the Commander, replied.</description>
