      <description>I came across a livestream called Nothing Forever1 which is a weird never ending fever dream of a pixelated, AI generated version of Seinfeld. Interestingly enough one of the things I was playing around with on ChatGPT2 myself was Seinfeld scripts as well.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what it is, but there is something about Seinfeld that seems to make it a good candidate for chucking at an AI. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just a latent memory of the &amp;lsquo;Modern Seinfeld&amp;rsquo; twitter bot of ages ago?</description>
