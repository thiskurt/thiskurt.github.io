      <description>Dorian Bae was the man Sabrina had dreamed of her whole life. No, that&amp;rsquo;s not true. He was more than she had ever dreamed of. He was more handsome. He was kinder.
He was, as her friend had put it, a hunk beyond dreams.
He had a chiseled and strong yet playful face with a smirk that could have saved the titanic, because it could melt anyone and anything.
His body was muscular and defined, but at the same time warm and inviting, with big arms that could wrap so tightly around you you would forget the whole world.</description>
