      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-fiery-tree&#34;&gt;The Fiery Tree&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There stood a Tree with branches of Fire at the heart of the World. The Tree illuminated the World as far as its light and heat would reach. Beyond the World there was only the Darkness. In the World there was everything, there was all the beauty and happiness there could ever be. All of Nature was there, the plants, the fields, the mountains, the rivers, the beaches, the desserts and all the animals. All of this was lit up by the Tree of Fire that stood in the center.&#xA;Last of all there was the Man and the Woman to whom the World belonged, even if they did not know it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
