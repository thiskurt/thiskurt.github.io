      <description>�Everybody calm down,� the Commander said, �We can�t panic. Panicking is what gets you killed when faced with a Dragon.�
�Not being fireproof is what gets you killed when faced with a Dragon,� Jerre corrected him, �That and not being able to fly.�
�We just need a plan.�
�I�ve got a plan!� Hrodebert said excitedly.
�What�s your plan?� the commander asked.
�When the Dragon strikes, we hit it with our swords.</description>

      <description>The small purple blob was yelling out in fear and desperately trying to grab on to the Dragon&amp;rsquo;s tail.
Just as she almost had it the Dragon took a nosedive and she lost her grip and the sleeve of dress which was hanging from one of the tail spikes started to rip.
The Dragon spit flames at the ground and used the updraft of the hot air to lift itself up more.</description>

      <description>After everyone was kissed awake the whole village gathered in the town square and it was all very awkward. Everyone was so quiet you could hear a mouse coughing.
&amp;ldquo;Thanks, I suppose, but who are you?&amp;rdquo; one of the villager asked breaking the silence.
&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re the Royal Guards,&amp;rdquo; the Commander explained.
&amp;ldquo;Royal Guards? We don&amp;rsquo;t have a King do we? I thought we had a Duke?&amp;rdquo; Another villager wondered in surprise.</description>

      <description>The Fairy had made it to the cave and, if they were as inept as they seemed, hopefully the Guards had left her enough time to undo the binding spell and prevent part two of her plan from waking up.
She slowly made her way through the golden coins, past the shining diamonds and the virgin skeletons. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for inflation and the alchemy bubble of the &amp;lsquo;90s she could&amp;rsquo;ve just grabbed the nearest handful and she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to bother with the whole plan.</description>

      <description>While everyone else was focusing on themselves and wasting time the Commander and the burly Guard were efficiently and orderly getting the job the done.
They would each switch between the tasks of kissing and explaining what the hell they were doing.
&amp;ldquo;The truth is Reinhilde&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;
Kiss.
&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;I think the Duke send us off on a pointless mission, because he doesn&amp;rsquo;t trust the King and he thinks we&amp;rsquo;re his spies.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I bet kissing an entire village is not what you imagined when you were dreaming of being a knight, was it?&amp;rdquo; Laura asked.
&amp;ldquo;I, well, I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s just, err, you know,&amp;rdquo; Hrodebert went red in the face. After he had stammered his way through through every filler word in the dictionary he managed to pull himself together and replied: &amp;ldquo;Did you dream? I mean, what was your dream growing up?</description>

      <description>What she was afraid of turned out to be true. Some band of idiots was waking up the whole village. That was the biggest flaw in her plan, anyone could walk into town and start waking them up.
If only the fairies had kept the antidote to the sleeping trick to themselves, but that was the trouble with fairies, they were always telling their tales.
She had to stop them, she would just put them under a sleeping spell too and keep the plan going.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;A whole town of sleeping beauties. Well,&amp;rdquo; Jerre eyed a woman sleeping on a pile of dirty linen, &amp;ldquo;in a manner of speaking. We&amp;rsquo;ve got quite the job ahead of us.&amp;rdquo;
He eyed the woman again and turned towards Aldric and Milena, &amp;ldquo;I think the Commander intended for me to have more of a supervising position in this task, I am a senior Guard after all. Why don&amp;rsquo;t you start, Aldric?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;You just interrupted a lovely Hex-Mex lunch, I hope it&amp;rsquo;s worth it,&amp;rdquo; the Head Godmother said.
&amp;ldquo;I think someone is breaking the sleeping spell.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I knew she shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have used the sleeping trick again, it&amp;rsquo;s outdated. She&amp;rsquo;s always resorting to the same tricks,&amp;rdquo; the Head Godmother&amp;rsquo;s assistant, who had always hated the Fairy, said.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not the same trick, it&amp;rsquo;s an entirely different scheme, just because the magic&amp;rsquo;s the same&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Bob and Laura, you cover the part of town past the bakery,&amp;rdquo; the Commander said, &amp;ldquo;Jerre, you and I&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Ahem,&amp;rdquo; Reinhilde, the burly, imposing guard who&amp;rsquo;d been standing next to the Commander ahemed. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re at it again,&amp;rdquo; she pointed towards the Dreamy Archer and the Beautiful Magic Wielder who were making out under a tree.
&amp;ldquo;Unbelievable. And they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be the Guards that are actually capable,&amp;rdquo; the Commander said ignoring the looks the other guards gave him, &amp;ldquo;Reinhilde, can you do something about this?</description>

      <description>The Fairy sensed her magic spell being broken. Someone in the village had already woken up. The duke couldn&amp;rsquo;t have arrived yet; someone else must have discovered the place. Whoever these fools were they were ruining everything, ruining her only chance to make it into the Fairy Godmothers.
The Fairy Godmothers where neither fairies nor godmothers, they were simply short, stout witches&amp;mdash;all of them; no one dared question their hiring practices&amp;mdash;with a knack for cons wrapped in fairy tale lore.</description>

      <description>“We better start kissing,” the Commander said.
This was not the kind of order you’d expect from a man like Commander Godfried, broad and serious looking with big bushy mutton chops that met up with an equally bushy moustache. He had the big frame and muscles of a knight and the gently expanding belly of a recent retiree.
“What!?” One of the guards, an old friend of the Commander, replied.</description>
