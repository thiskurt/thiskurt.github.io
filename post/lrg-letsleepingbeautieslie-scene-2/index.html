  <p>The Fairy sensed her magic spell being broken. Someone in the village had already woken up. The duke couldn&rsquo;t have arrived yet; someone else must have discovered the place. Whoever these fools were they were ruining everything, ruining her only chance to make it into the Fairy Godmothers.</p>

<p>The Fairy Godmothers where neither fairies nor godmothers, they were simply short, stout witches&mdash;all of them; no one dared question their hiring practices&mdash;with a knack for cons wrapped in fairy tale lore. Their exploits had earned them the nickname &lsquo;Fairy Conmothers&rsquo;.</p>

<p>This &lsquo;Fairy&rsquo; was born to join the Godmothers; she wasn&rsquo;t just short and stout she was round, really, really round. She was almost perfectly spherical. A little round ball. That&rsquo;s why she never wore orange, she didn&rsquo;t want people trying to peel her.</p>

<p>As far back as she could remember she always wanted to be a Godmother. To her it was better than being a beautiful princess, better than being a powerful witch, better than any quest she could ever go on.</p>

<p>The Fairy Godmothers were notoriously reserved and wouldn&rsquo;t let anyone inside their circle. There were only ever seven Fairy Godmothers, no more, and there were always hundreds of little witches waiting for an opening. Some were not happy to just sit around and wait. The Assassin&rsquo;s Guild declined every job involving a Fairy Godmother and being discovered trying to kill a Fairy Godmother yourself was a sure-fire way not to get the position, so most just sat around waiting unhappily.</p>

<p>The Fairy tried to work her way up to them by joining the local Thieves&rsquo; Guild, she had considered joining the Con Artist Guild, but they turned out to be a scam for people who want to become con artists, but are too stupid to realize it&rsquo;s a bad idea to walk into a Con Artist Guild.</p>

<p>After a few months of being a thief in the capital the Guild kicked her out for breaking the Immorality Clause. They accused her of a total lack of a lack of a moral compass.</p>

<p>So she went at it on her own, making sure that her schemes drew plenty of attention, hoping to catch the eye of one of the Godmothers.</p>

<p>Eventually, she was given the opportunity to prove herself to the Fairy Godmothers. She had to pull off one fairy con on her own as a test. She had settled on an old classic called The Sleeping Beauty, perfect for trapping princes, but she was sure a duke wouldn&rsquo;t be any harder. She believed a lone princess wasn&rsquo;t enough to draw attention anymore, so she had dialed it up to thirteen by making it a whole town. And by throwing in a little extra surprise.</p>

<p>It was this surprise waking up that was worrying her.</p>
